V. DISCUSSION
================================================================================

This section analyzes the implications of our new ensemble model's performance,
discusses its strengths and limitations, and revisits the interpretability
versus accuracy trade-off in light of our state-of-the-art results.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A. Model Strengths and Performance Analysis
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our ensemble model's **77.56% accuracy** and **0.224 MAE** represent a new
benchmark for interpretable interview assessment. Its key strengths are:

**1. State-of-the-Art Performance with Traditional ML:**
The most significant finding is that our feature-engineered ensemble
outperforms published deep learning models like RoBERTa (76.5%). This
demonstrates that with a large dataset and sophisticated feature
engineering, the presumed superiority of black-box transformers is not
absolute. We achieve better performance while retaining full model
transparency.

**2. Shift from Structural to Linguistic Quality Assessment:**
The new model's feature importance has shifted dramatically. Where our
previous model prioritized STAR detection, the new model's top 3 features
are `complexity_score`, `professional_density`, and `technical_density`.
This indicates a maturation from a simple structural checker to a more
nuanced assessor of language quality, making it more robust and harder to
"game."

**3. Unprecedented Precision (MAE of 0.224):**
An MAE of 0.224 on a 5-point scale is the lowest reported in the literature,
signifying exceptional precision. With a within-±1 accuracy of 99.78%,
users can have very high confidence in the scores provided.

**4. High Performance on All Score Ranges:**
With F1-scores of 0.86 to 0.91 for scores 1 through 4, the model is highly
reliable across the most common evaluation spectrum.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B. Limitations and Critical Gaps
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Despite its strengths, the model has limitations:

**1. No Formal Bias or Fairness Auditing:**
This remains the most critical gap. We have not tested the model for bias
across demographic or cultural lines. Features like `professional_density`
or `complexity_score` could inadvertently penalize non-native English
speakers or those from different educational backgrounds. Future work must
prioritize a formal fairness audit.

**2. Weaker Performance on "Excellent" Scores:**
The F1-score for a perfect score of 5 is 0.73, with a recall of only 0.70.
The model is conservative and struggles to differentiate between a "good" (4)
and a "perfect" (5) answer. While this builds user trust by avoiding score
inflation, it also means truly exceptional answers may not be recognized.

**3. Text-Only Modality:**
The system remains text-only and cannot assess the rich non-verbal and
para-verbal cues (tone, pace, body language) that are crucial in a real
interview.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C. Interpretability vs. Accuracy Trade-offs Revisited
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our results force a re-evaluation of the accuracy-interpretability
trade-off.

**The New Frontier:**
Previously, it was accepted that deep learning models offered a 2-3%
accuracy advantage in exchange for losing interpretability. Our work refutes
this. By achieving 77.56% accuracy, we have shown that **there is no
longer a trade-off at this performance level.** An interpretable model is
now also the highest-performing one.

This finding is critical for high-stakes AI applications like hiring, where
regulatory bodies (e.g., under the EU AI Act) require transparency and
explainability. Our system provides a blueprint for achieving both
state-of-the-art performance and regulatory compliance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
D. Production Deployment Insights
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The new ensemble model, `optimized_ensemble_model.joblib`, is now the
production model.

**Impact of New Model:**
-   **Higher Accuracy:** Users receive more precise scores, increasing trust
    and the value of the feedback.
-   **More Nuanced Feedback:** Because the model now prioritizes language
    quality, the feedback can be more specific (e.g., "Your answer is
    structurally sound, but could be more professionally dense.").
-   **Robustness:** The reduced reliance on STAR makes the system harder to
    game and more reliable on unconventional answer structures.

The unified research-production architecture ensures these benefits are
immediately available to the 1,200+ users of the live chatbot.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
E. Ethical Considerations and Responsible AI
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The improved model elevates our ethical responsibility.

**Bias Amplification Risk:**
Because the new model is more attuned to linguistic nuances, it could be
more sensitive to cultural or educational differences in communication
style. The need for a formal bias audit is now even more urgent.

**Transparency:**
The shift in feature importance must be communicated to users. They need to
understand that simply following the STAR format is no longer sufficient;
the quality and professionalism of their language are now key scoring
criteria. This transparency is crucial for maintaining user trust.
