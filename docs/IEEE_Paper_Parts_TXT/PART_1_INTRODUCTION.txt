ABSTRACT
================================================================================

This paper presents a comprehensive machine learning system for automated 
interview response assessment, achieving 74.75% exact match accuracy and 
97.66% within-±1 accuracy on a diverse dataset of 3,334 interview 
question-answer pairs. Unlike recent approaches relying on large language 
models, our system employs interpretable feature engineering with 23 
handcrafted features across seven categories, including STAR 
(Situation-Task-Action-Result) component detection, linguistic metrics, and 
domain-specific keywords. We utilize Random Forest classification combined 
with TF-IDF cosine similarity for dual scoring, providing both structural 
quality assessment and content alignment measurement. Our approach 
demonstrates competitive performance with recent deep learning methods while 
maintaining transparency and generating actionable feedback. The system 
achieves a Mean Absolute Error of 0.280, outperforming comparable approaches, 
with comprehensive evaluation on 1,667 held-out samples using 5-fold 
cross-validation. This work contributes a unified research-production 
architecture, large-scale diverse dataset from seven sources, and validated 
STAR format detection methodology applicable to behavioral interview 
assessment.

I. INTRODUCTION
================================================================================

Interviews remain the cornerstone of employee selection processes across 
industries and organizational contexts. Despite their ubiquity, traditional 
interview methodologies face persistent challenges including interviewer bias, 
inconsistent evaluation criteria, limited scalability, and substantial 
resource requirements. These limitations have intensified in recent years due 
to evolving workforce dynamics, remote hiring practices, and the growing 
demand for objective, data-driven assessment methodologies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A. Motivation and Background
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Job interviews represent a fundamental yet challenging component of modern 
talent acquisition and human resource management. Organizations worldwide 
invest substantial resources—estimated at $4,000 per hire on average in the 
United States—in conducting, coordinating, and evaluating candidate 
interviews [1]. Despite this investment, traditional interview processes face 
persistent challenges:

1. HIGH TIME REQUIREMENTS: 12-15 hours per successful hire, constraining 
   organizational throughput and delaying talent acquisition timelines.

2. LIMITED SCALABILITY: Senior interviewers constrained by calendar 
   availability, creating bottlenecks in high-volume hiring periods.

3. SUBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT VARIABILITY: Inter-rater reliability as low as 0.52 
   [2], leading to inconsistent candidate evaluations and potential legal 
   challenges.

4. UNCONSCIOUS BIAS: Systematic demographic biases affecting hiring decisions 
   [3], undermining diversity and inclusion initiatives.

5. LACK OF IMMEDIATE FEEDBACK: Candidates receive minimal actionable guidance 
   for improvement, limiting skill development opportunities.

The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated demand for remote assessment solutions, 
while simultaneously highlighting inefficiencies in traditional face-to-face 
interview processes [4]. As organizations increasingly recognize 
competency-based hiring as superior to credential-based selection [5], the 
need for scalable, objective, and consistent competency assessment has 
intensified. Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly natural 
language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML), present unprecedented 
opportunities to address these challenges through intelligent automation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B. Research Problem Statement
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Current automated interview assessment systems face three critical limitations 
that constrain their practical adoption:

**LIMITATION 1: Limited Accuracy and Generalization**

Published systems report accuracies ranging from 48.9% to 75.1% [6-9], with 
significant performance degradation when applied to data distributions 
different from training sets. Cross-domain accuracy drops of 20-30 percentage 
points are common, limiting real-world deployability. For example, Siswanto 
et al. [6] report 79.3% accuracy on same-distribution data but only 48.9-70% 
when applied to cross-domain interviews, representing a catastrophic 30-point 
degradation.

**LIMITATION 2: Insufficient Interpretability**

Deep learning approaches achieve competitive accuracy but operate as black 
boxes, providing predictions without explanations [9]. This opacity undermines 
user trust and prevents generation of actionable feedback—a critical 
requirement for interview preparation systems. Candidates receiving a score of 
"6/10" without understanding why cannot improve their performance, rendering 
such systems pedagogically ineffective.

**LIMITATION 3: Coverage and Robustness Gaps**

Existing TF-IDF-based approaches suffer from "all-zero result" conditions 
where 37-63% of responses cannot be scored due to insufficient vocabulary 
overlap with reference answers [6]. This coverage gap renders them unsuitable 
for production deployment, as no system can reject over one-third of user 
inputs. No published system reports 100% coverage with maintained accuracy.

These limitations necessitate a fundamentally different approach that balances 
accuracy, interpretability, robustness, and practical deployability.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C. Research Objectives
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This research addresses the aforementioned limitations through the following 
six primary objectives:

OBJECTIVE 1: DEVELOP HIGH-ACCURACY, ROBUST ML MODEL
Achieve competitive performance (target: >70% exact match accuracy, >95% 
within-±1 accuracy) on diverse, heterogeneous interview data without coverage 
gaps. The model must handle technical, behavioral, and leadership interviews 
across multiple domains with consistent performance.

OBJECTIVE 2: ENGINEER COMPREHENSIVE INTERPRETABLE FEATURES
Capture linguistic, structural, semantic, and behavioral dimensions of 
interview responses through 23+ handcrafted features, enabling transparent 
scoring rationale and actionable feedback generation. Each feature must be 
human-understandable and directly mappable to interview quality dimensions.

OBJECTIVE 3: CONSTRUCT LARGE-SCALE, MULTI-SOURCE DATASET
Build a dataset exceeding 3,000 samples spanning technical (machine learning, 
deep learning, web development), behavioral (teamwork, problem-solving), and 
leadership interviews. Multi-source construction ensures model generalization 
across interview contexts and reduces single-source bias.

OBJECTIVE 4: IMPLEMENT PRODUCTION-READY DUAL SCORING SYSTEM
Combine supervised ML predictions (structural/quality assessment) with TF-IDF 
semantic similarity (content alignment evaluation) for comprehensive response 
evaluation. This dual perspective addresses both "how well did you answer?" 
and "did you cover the right topics?"

OBJECTIVE 5: CONDUCT RIGOROUS BENCHMARKING
Compare against recent publications (2021-2025) using standardized metrics 
(accuracy, MAE, precision, recall, F1-score) to validate competitive 
performance. Benchmarking must include both traditional ML and deep learning 
approaches to establish relative positioning.

OBJECTIVE 6: DEPLOY PRACTICAL CHATBOT INTERFACE
Enable 24/7 interview practice with immediate feedback, session logging, and 
competency tracking across 15+ skill categories. The production system must 
use the same dataset and algorithms as the research implementation to ensure 
findings translate to real-world impact.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
D. Key Contributions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This work makes the following seven significant contributions to automated 
interview assessment research:

**C1: NOVEL 23-FEATURE FRAMEWORK**

We introduce a comprehensive feature engineering approach capturing seven 
dimensions:

1. Basic Linguistics: Word count, sentence count, average sentence length, 
   unique word ratio, character count

2. STAR Format Components: Situation detection, Task detection, Action 
   detection, Result detection (binary indicators)

3. Domain-Specific Keywords: Action verbs (68 verbs), technical terms (120 
   terms), metric/quantification presence, leadership keywords, 
   problem-solving keywords

4. Structural Quality: Example presence, completeness score, paragraph 
   structure

5. Confidence Markers: Confidence words, hedging words

6. Advanced Linguistics: Complex sentence ratio, professional vocabulary score

7. Semantic Similarity: TF-IDF cosine similarity (answer-reference), TF-IDF 
   cosine similarity (answer-question)

This framework achieves superior performance compared to TF-IDF-only 
approaches while maintaining full interpretability. Ablation studies 
demonstrate 15.83% accuracy drop when using basic linguistics alone versus 
7.52% drop when removing STAR features—validating the importance of 
comprehensive feature diversity.

**C2: DUAL SCORING METHODOLOGY**

We present a hybrid evaluation approach combining:
- Random Forest classification (200 trees, 23 features) for structural/quality 
  assessment yielding 1-10 scores
- NLTK-preprocessed TF-IDF cosine similarity for content alignment yielding 
  0-100% similarity scores

This dual perspective provides comprehensive feedback addressing both "how 
well did you answer?" (ML score: structure, completeness, STAR format) and 
"did you cover the right topics?" (similarity score: keyword overlap, semantic 
alignment). Unlike Wang et al. [8] who process ML and TF-IDF sequentially, 
our architecture implements simultaneous dual scoring with integrated NLTK 
preprocessing, achieving 1.35 percentage point improvement.

**C3: LARGE-SCALE MULTI-SOURCE DATASET**

We curated 3,334 interview question-answer pairs from seven diverse sources:

1. Kaggle Machine Learning Interview Questions (735 samples)
2. Kaggle Deep Learning Interview Questions (735 samples)
3. LinkedIn Job Postings Dataset (487 samples)
4. Tech Job Boards Aggregation - Glassdoor/Indeed/Stack Overflow (398 samples)
5. HR Employee Attrition Dataset (316 samples)
6. Web Development Q&A Dataset (663 samples)
7. Additional curated sources (various)

This represents a 2.76× increase over comparable studies (median dataset size: 
1,205 samples) and ensures cross-domain generalization. Score distribution: 
1-4 (12%), 5-6 (28%), 7-8 (41%), 9-10 (19%). STAR coverage: 68% (2,266/3,334 
samples contain detectable STAR elements).

**C4: INDUSTRY-LEADING PERFORMANCE**

Our model achieves:
- 74.75% exact match accuracy (beats 10 of 11 comparable publications)
- 97.66% within-±1 accuracy (near-perfect practical performance)
- MAE of 0.280 (lowest reported in interview assessment literature)
- 76.31% ± 1.32% cross-validation accuracy (demonstrates stability)

Comparative benchmarking:
- Beats Wang et al. 2024 (73.4%) by +1.35%
- Beats Chen et al. 2023 (73.8%) by +0.95%
- Beats Thompson et al. 2023 (68.0%) by +6.75%
- Beats Hickman et al. 2024 MAE (0.31) by -9.7%
- Only loses to Kumar & Singh 2024 (75.1%) by -0.35%

**C5: UNIFIED RESEARCH-PRODUCTION ARCHITECTURE**

Unlike typical academic systems where research models differ from production 
implementations (leading to data drift and performance degradation), we employ 
a single shared dataset and codebase for both experimental validation and 
production chatbot deployment. This ensures:
- Research findings directly benefit end users
- No train-deployment distribution mismatch
- Continuous validation through real-world usage
- Immediate feedback on model limitations

The production chatbot has processed thousands of interview practice sessions 
using the same feature extraction and scoring algorithms validated in research 
experiments.

**C6: VALIDATED STAR DETECTION METHODOLOGY**

We demonstrate effective automated detection of STAR (Situation-Task-Action-
Result) components in behavioral interview responses using regex-based keyword 
matching:

- Situation: 23 keywords ("when", "time", "situation", "context", 
  "background"...)
- Task: 18 keywords ("responsible", "goal", "objective", "challenge", 
  "asked"...)
- Action: 68 action verbs ("implemented", "developed", "analyzed", "led", 
  "coordinated"...)
- Result: Numeric patterns + 31 outcome keywords ("increased", "improved", 
  "achieved", "reduced"...)

Achieving 68% coverage across dataset with binary classification for each 
component enables specific structural feedback generation ("Your answer 
mentions the Situation and Action but lacks quantifiable Results").

**C7: COMPREHENSIVE BENCHMARKING**

We provide detailed comparative analysis against 11 recent publications 
(2021-2025):

Outperformed Papers (10):
1. Wang et al. 2024 - 73.4%
2. Chen et al. 2023 - 73.8%
3. Zhang et al. 2023 - 73.2%
4. Patel et al. 2022 - 72.9%
5. Thompson et al. 2023 - 68.0%
6. Siswanto et al. 2022 - 79.3%* (but 48.9-70% cross-domain, 37% coverage gap)
7. Raghavan et al. 2022 - 68.5%
8. Hickman et al. 2024 - 74.0%, MAE 0.31
9. Geathers et al. 2025 - 72.0%, MAE 0.35
10. Uppalapati et al. 2025 - 70.0%

Papers Beating Us (1):
11. Kumar & Singh 2024 - 75.1% (margin: 0.35%, but single-org dataset vs our 
    7-source diversity)

This demonstrates that traditional feature engineering combined with Random 
Forest can match or exceed deep learning approaches while maintaining 
interpretability and lower computational requirements (200-tree Random Forest 
vs multi-billion parameter transformers).
